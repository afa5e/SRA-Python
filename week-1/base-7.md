# Base 7

This task requires you to ask the user for an integer in base 10 and convert it to base 7.

Base 10 means that we only have 10 different symbols for number, from 0 to 9. Each column represents a value that is 10 times greater than the next.

Base 7 only has seven symbols, 0 to 6. And each column is 7 times bigger than the next.

## Example:

| Base 10 | Base 7 |
|---------|--------|
| 10      | 13     |
| 7       | 1      |
| 100     | 202    |

## Program output

Input base 7: 202

202 base 7 is 100 in base 10

## Extension

Ask the user for a base number below 10 and a number in that base, then convert to base 10.
